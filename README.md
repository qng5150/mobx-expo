# Simple Project showing how to use MobX reaction with React Context

Ideas behind this project.

1. Develop a store that has an observabile item
2. Inject the store using Context Provider
3. Inject the store into another child widget using useContext
4. Create a mutation using react hooks that then send the update using an action on the store
